1 Introduction
**************

"Haskell Mode" is a major mode providing a convenient environment for
editing Haskell (http://www.haskell.org) programs.

   Some of its major features are:

   * Syntax highlighting (font lock),

   * automatic indentation,

   * on-the-fly documentation,

   * interaction with inferior GHCi/Hugs instance, and

   * scanning declarations and placing them in a menu.

3 Getting Started
*****************

If you are reading this, you have most likely already managed to
install Haskell Mode in one way or another. However, just for the
record, the officially recommended way to install Haskell Mode via the
Marmalade package archive
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/haskell-mode) which contains the
latest stable release of Haskell Mode.

   Most of Haskell Mode's settings are configurable via customizable
variables (*Note Easy Customization: (emacs)Easy Customization, for
details). You can use `M-x haskell-customize' to browse the `haskell'
customization sub-tree.

   One of the important setting you should customize is the
`haskell-mode-hook' variable (*note Hooks: (emacs)Hooks.) which gets
run right after the `haskell-mode' major mode is initialized for a
buffer. You can customize `haskell-mode-hook' by `M-x
customize-variable <RET> haskell-mode-hook'. It's highly recommended
you set up indentation to match to match your preferences, *Note
Indentation::.

4 Editing Haskell Code
**********************

"Haskell Mode" is actually a collection of so-called major modes(1) one
of which is called `haskell-mode'.  To avoid confusion, when referring
to this package the name "Haskell mode" is written in a normal font,
whereas when referring the major mode of the same name `haskell-mode'
written with a dash in-between in a typewriter font is used.

   As one might guess, `haskell-mode' is the (programming language(2))
major mode for editing (non-literate) Haskell source code.
`haskell-mode' is associated with the file extensions listed below by
default(3).

`.hs'
     official file extension for (non-literate) Haskell 98/2010 files

`.hsc'
     "almost-Haskell" input file for the hsc2hs
     (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/hsc2hs.html)
     pre-processor

`.cpphs'
     input file for the cpphs (http://projects.haskell.org/cpphs/)
     pre-processor

The major mode `literate-haskell-mode' (which is derived from
`haskell-mode' and thus transitively from `prog-mode') provides support
for literate Haskell programs
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Literate_programming) and is
associated with the `.lhs' file extension by default.

   `literate-haskell-mode' supports Bird-style as well as TeX-style
literate Haskell files. The currently detected literate Haskell variant
is shown in the mode line (*note Mode Line: (emacs)Mode Line.) as
either `LitHaskell/bird' or `LitHaskell/tex'.

5 Unicode support
*****************

See the Haskell Wiki's entry on Unicode Symbols
(http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Unicode-symbols) for general
information about Unicode support in Haskell.

   As Emacs supports editing files containing Unicode out of the box,
so does Haskell Mode. As an add-on, Haskell Mode includes the
`haskell-unicode' input method which allows you to easily type a number
of Unicode symbols that are useful when writing Haskell code; for more
details *Note Input Methods: (emacs)Input Methods.

   To automatically enable the `haskell-unicode' input method in
haskell-mode buffers use `M-x customize-variable <RET>
haskell-mode-hook' or put the following code in your `.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-unicode-input-method)

To temporarily enable this input method for a single buffer you can use
`M-x turn-on-haskell-unicode-input-method'.

   When the `haskell-unicode' input method is active, you can simply
type `->' and it is immediately replaced with `→'. Use `C-\' to toggle
the input method. To see a table of all key sequences use `M-x
describe-input-method <RET> haskell-unicode'. A sequence like `<=' is
ambiguous and can mean either `⇐' or `≤'. Typing it presents you with a
choice. Type `1' or `2' to select an option or keep typing to use the
default option.

   If you don't like the highlighting of partially matching tokens you
can turn it off by setting `input-method-highlight-flag' to `nil' via
`M-x customize-variable'.

6 Indentation
*************

For general information about GNU Emacs' support for indentation *Note
Indentation: (emacs)Indentation.

   In Haskell, code indentation has semantic meaning as it defines the
block structure(1).

   As GNU Emacs' default indentation function (i.e. `indent-relative')
is not designed for use with Haskell's layout rule, Haskell mode
includes three different indentation minor modes with different
trade-offs:

`turn-on-haskell-simple-indent'
     A very simple indentation scheme; In this scheme, <TAB> will now
     move the cursor to the next indent point in the previous non-blank
     line.  An indent point is a non-whitespace character following
     whitespace.

`turn-on-haskell-indent'
     Intelligent semi-automatic indentation for Haskell's layout rule.
     The basic idea is to have <TAB> cycle through possibilities
     indentation points based on some clever heuristics.

     The rationale and the implementation principles are described in
     more detail the article `Dynamic tabbing for automatic indentation
     with the layout rule' published in the Journal of Functional
     Programming 8.5 (1998).

`turn-on-haskell-indentation'
     Improved variation of `turn-on-haskell-indent' indentation mode.
     Rebinds <RET> and <DEL>, so that indentations can be set and
     deleted as if they were real tabs.


   To enable one of these three mutually exclusive indentation schemes,
you just need call one (and only one!) of the `turn-on-*' commands
while in the buffer you want the indentation scheme to be activated for.

   The recommended way is to add one of `turn-on-*' commands to
`haskell-mode-hook'. This can be done either by using `M-x
customize-variable <RET> haskell-mode-hook' which provides a convenient
user interface or by adding _one_ the following three lines to your
`.emacs' file:

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-simple-indent)
     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-indent)
     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-indentation)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Haskell also supports braces and semicolons notation for
conveying the block structure. However, most Haskell written by humans
uses indentation for block structuring.


File: haskell-mode.info,  Node: haskell-decl-scan-mode,  Next: inferior-haskell-mode,  Prev: Indentation,  Up: Top

7 `haskell-decl-scan-mode'
**************************

`haskell-decl-scan-mode' is a minor mode which performs declaration
scanning and provides `M-x imenu' support (*Note Imenu: (emacs)Imenu,
for more information).

   For non-literate and TeX-style literate scripts, the common
convention that top-level declarations start at the first column is
assumed.  For Bird-style literate scripts, the common convention that
top-level declarations start at the third column, ie. after `> ', is
assumed.

   When `haskell-decl-scan-mode' is active, the standard Emacs
top-level definition movement commands (*note Moving by Defuns:
(emacs)Moving by Defuns.) are enabled to operate on Haskell
declarations:

`C-M-a'
     Move to beginning of current or preceding declaration
     (`beginning-of-defun').

`C-M-e'
     Move to end of current or following declaration (`end-of-defun').

`C-M-h'
     Select whole current or following declaration (`mark-defun').

   Moreover, if enabled via the option
`haskell-decl-scan-add-to-menubar', a menu item "Declarations" is added
to the menu bar listing the scanned declarations and allowing to jump
to declarations in the source buffer.

   It's recommended to have font lock mode enabled (*note Font Lock:
(emacs)Font Lock.) as `haskell-decl-scan-mode' ignores text highlighted
with `font-lock-comment-face'.

   As usual, in order to activate `haskell-decl-scan-mode'
automatically for Haskell buffers, add `turn-on-haskell-decl-scan' to
`haskell-mode-hook':

     (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-decl-scan)

   `haskell-decl-scan-mode' enables the use of features that build upon
`imenu' support such as Speedbar Frames (*note Speedbar:
(emacs)Speedbar.) or the global "Which Function" minor mode (*note
Which Function: (emacs)Which Function.).

   In order to enable `which-function-mode' for Haskell buffers you
need to add the following to your Emacs initialization:

     (eval-after-load "which-func"
       '(add-to-list 'which-func-modes 'haskell-mode))

8 `inferior-haskell-mode'
*************************

The major mode `inferior-haskell-mode' provides support for interacting
with an inferior Haskell process.

   The Haskell interpreter used by the inferior Haskell mode is
auto-detected by default, but is customizable via the
`haskell-program-name' variable.

   Currently, GHCi and Hugs are support as Haskell interpreter.

9 `haskell-interactive-mode'
****************************

A new mode for the REPL (read–eval–print loop) and GHCi sessions is
called `haskell-interactive-mode', it intends to replace
`inferior-haskell-mode', but comes with a different set of features.
