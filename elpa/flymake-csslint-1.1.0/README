flymake-csslint

flymake-csslint.el is an Emacs integration of CSSLint. The
implementation is very much based on flymake-jshint.el by Wilfred
Hughes.

Installation and usage

The easiest way to install flymake-csslint is probably to install it via
the ELPA archive at Marmalade.

ELPA (package.el) is part of Emacs 24. For Emacs 23 see Marmalade for
installation instructions.

If you don't install via ELPA make sure that flymake-csslint.el is in
your load-path and require the library

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/path/to/flymake-csslint")
    (require 'flymake-csslint)

Requirements

To use CSSLint with emacs, you will need to have a command line version
of CSSLint installed, see installation instructions at
https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/wiki/Command-line-interface.

If the csslint executable is not available on your PATH your need to
configure the flymake-csslint-program variable and let it point to the
executable.

    M-x customize-variable <RET> flymake-csslint-program <RET>

Debugging

If CSSLint isn't working for any reason, execute

    M-x set-variable <RET> flymake-log-level <RET> 3 <RET>

and you will see what is going wrong listed in the Messages buffer.

Development of flymake-csslint

reports, and pull request are more that welcome!
