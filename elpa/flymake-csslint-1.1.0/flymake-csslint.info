*****************

flymake-csslint.el is an Emacs (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs)
integration of CSSLint (https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint). The
implementation is very much based on flymake-jshint.el
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/flymake-jshint) by Wilfred Hughes
(http://wilfred.me.uk).

1.1 Installation and usage
==========================

The easiest way to install flymake-csslint is probably to install it
via the ELPA archive at Marmalade
(http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/flymake-csslint).

   ELPA (package.el) is part of Emacs 24. For Emacs 23 see Marmalade
(http://marmalade-repo.org) for installation instructions.

   If you don't install via ELPA make sure that flymake-csslint.el is
in your load-path and require the library

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/path/to/flymake-csslint")
(require 'flymake-csslint)

1.2 Requirements
================

To use CSSLint (https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint) with emacs,
you will need to have a command line version of CSSLint installed, see
installation instructions at
https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/wiki/Command-line-interface.

   If the `csslint' executable is not available on your PATH your need
to configure the flymake-csslint-program variable and let it point to
the executable.

M-x customize-variable <RET> flymake-csslint-program <RET>

1.3 Debugging
=============

If CSSLint isn't working for any reason, execute

M-x set-variable <RET> flymake-log-level <RET> 3 <RET>

   and you will see what is going wrong listed in the _Messages_ buffer.
