(autoload 'worklog-do-task "worklog" "\
Append TASK to the worklog.
If there is an ongoing task, you are given the option to declare it done or
stopped, or to cancel the operation.

`worklog-do-task' allows you to insert tasks into your worklog without
the need to interactively call it.

If autostop is set to non-nil, any running task will automatically be stopped.

\(fn TASK &optional AUTOSTOP)" nil nil)

(autoload 'worklog-task-begin "worklog" "\
Convenience function for `worklog-do-task'.

Does the same as calling`worklog-do-task' with a string parameter.

\(fn TASK)" t nil)

(autoload 'worklog-summarize-tasks "worklog" "\
Display a summary of the worklog in two sections.
The first section is a reverse-chronological list of tasks and their durations,
and the second is an unsorted compendium of all tasks and total durations.
Durations are measured in hours.  If invoked non-interactively (i.e., \"emacs
--batch\"), the display buffer is sent to `message'.

This summary is displayed over the entire worklog file, it is an convenience 
function for `worklog-do-summarize-tasks-between-dates'
